    <h1>Welcome to Linux From Scratch</h1>
    <p>
      Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step
      instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from
      source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, the Linux From Scratch organization consists of the following
      subprojects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>LFS</h3>
        Linux From Scratch is the main book, the base from which all other
        projects are derived.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>BLFS</h3>
        Beyond Linux From Scratch helps you extend your finished LFS
        installation into a more customized and usable system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>ALFS</h3>
        <p>
          Automated Linux From Scratch provides tools for automating and
          managing LFS and BLFS builds.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Hints</h3>
        <p>
          The Hints project is a collection of documents that explain how to
          enhance your LFS system in ways that are not included in the LFS or
          BLFS books.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Patches</h3>
        <p>
          The Patches project serves as a central repository for all patches
          useful to an LFS user.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>LFS Editor's Guide</h3>
        <p>A document that describes the LFS development process.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Museum</h3>
        <p>Copies of ancient LFS and BLFS versions.</p>
