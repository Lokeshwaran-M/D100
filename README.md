### HTML - know it
<p>
what HTML is, 
how do we use it to build web pages 
how browsers use that HTML to display those web pages to us.
What is HTML documents, 
what are all the different parts of the document that we need to use to create that.

Now HTML's been around for a long time, and it's aged very well. When it was first introduced, it was really about research documents and being able to share the information that researchers or educators had found out. They wanted to be able to share that with their peers, they wanted to be able to link to related research, display their data and tables, and maybe show some graphs or pictures. But today, HTML is used to build online store fronts, full-blown applications, file sharing, photo sharing, big social media applications. 

They have very interactive interfaces, and they're graphically rich. So while it started as a very text-based, link-based sort of tool, HTML has aged and is still the core foundational component that we use to build web pages in all the different types of websites that we use. We now have more tools to make those pages richer visually and interactively,

we also have more responsibilities because not everyone's going to be viewing these on a big monitor at a desktop, maybe on a laptop, a tablet, or a phone. So being able to design documents that can render properly is an important factor. And we'll touch on that concept, known as responsive design, as we go through the course. 

So what is HTML? Well HTML is a markup language. That means that we're going to take the text from that research document back in the day or that product description and other information or social media comments and posts and we're going to wrap it in this markup language. And this provides additional information to the client, from now on I'll refer to that as the browser because that's the most common client for HTML, to use to render that data that we've got in the document. 

That markup information isn't displayed, it's instructions for the browser on how it should display those things. The browsers then interpret that, and they render the document. At the most basic level, that might be some text that we markup to indicate that it should be rendered as a paragraph. Or it may be part of the page, and we indicate that it needs to have a background image. 

First, HTML itself stands for Hypertext Markup Language. I've already talked about what a markup language is. Hypertext is a fancy way of saying text, but it does have some meaning in that that text document goes beyond simple text. 
I may have mentioned the Hypertext Transport Protocol, or HTTP. This is the method by which we exchange these HTML documents. 
We have a document on a particular computer, and we want somebody in a browser on a different computer to be able to view it. 

They need to use HTTP to request that document and receive it back in their browser. I'll mention the URI and a URL interchangeably, and these are simply addresses.
