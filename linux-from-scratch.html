    <h2>Welcome to Linux From Scratch!</h2>

    <p>Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own
        custom Linux system, entirely from source code.</p>

    <h3>Currently, the Linux From Scratch organization consists of the following subprojects:</h3>
    <h4>LFS</h4>
    <p>Linux From Scratch is the main book, the base from which all other projects are derived.</p>
    <h4>BLFS</h4>
    <p>Beyond Linux From Scratch helps you extend your finished LFS installation into a more customized and
        usable system.</p>
    <h4>ALFS</h4>
    <p>Automated Linux From Scratch provides tools for automating and managing LFS and BLFS builds.</p>
    <h4>Hints</h4>
    <p>The Hints project is a collection of documents that explain how to enhance your LFS system in ways
        that are not included in the LFS or BLFS books.</p>
    <h4>Patches</h4>
    <p>The Patches project serves as a central repository for all patches useful to an LFS user.</p>
    <h4>LFS Editor's Guide</h4>
    <p>A document that describes the LFS development process.</p>
    <h4>Museum</h4>
    <p>Copies of ancient LFS and BLFS versions.</p>
